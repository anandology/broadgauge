Hello everyone,

This year, Python Month is back in all its glory, but with a new face and a new plan. Python Month is now Python Express! There were two main motivations behind this idea.

One is the tremendous response that we got last year both in terms of trainers willing to teach, as well as colleges and institutions willing to organize workshops. Both these factors made us think, "Why stop with just one month?". Hence, Python Express is going to be an ongoing effort.

The second motivation was the lessons learned from organizing such an initiative without the proper use of technology. A lot of time was spent in match making and house keeping the records related to all the workshops. After having understood what would save everyone's time when automated, we've built this brand new website for Python Express!

What should you do?
-------------------

Sign up as a trainer on the Python Express website and check the list of colleges that are willing to organize workshops. If you find any of them to be suitable for you to go and teach at, Express Interest in that particular college. Once you are accepted, you will be notified and things can be taken forward from there.

If you are interested in organizing a Python workshop, sign up as an organization/institution on the Python Express website. The trainers who have already signed up will be able to see your institution. If they are interested, they will Express Interest in your institution. Once that happens, you will be able to accept them and take it forward.

Spread the word and let us spread the love of Python far and wide.

Sincerely,

The Python Express team.
